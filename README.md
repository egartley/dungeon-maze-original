# Purpose 

Software Engineering semester long project. The project is open to what a team decides. As a team the best route we choose was to make a Maze game. The main purpose of the game is to get to the end. As additional features once we get the main game working we choose to possibly add coins, weapons, boosters, and as well as enemies that you may or may not have to kill. Inspiration came from Crossy Road and Temple Run as well as the movie Maze Runner.
